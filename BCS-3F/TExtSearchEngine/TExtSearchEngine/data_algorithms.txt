An algorithm is a finite sequence of well-defined instructions typically used to solve a class of specific problems or to perform a computation. Algorithms are used as specifications for performing calculations and data processing. Sorting algorithms arrange elements in a certain order. Popular sorting algorithms include quicksort, mergesort, heapsort, and insertion sort. Searching algorithms retrieve information stored within some data structure. Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list. Graph algorithms solve problems related to graph theory. Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between nodes in a graph. Dynamic programming is both a mathematical optimization method and a computer programming method. Greedy algorithms make locally optimal choices at each stage with the hope of finding a global optimum.
