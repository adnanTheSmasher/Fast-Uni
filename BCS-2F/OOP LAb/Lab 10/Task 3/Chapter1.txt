Title: "The Emberlight Chronicles"
Chapter 1: The Spark Beneath the Stone

In the quiet village of Windmere, nestled between the shadow of the Wyvernspire Mountains and the whispering pines of the Elderwood, magic was little more than myth. Children told stories of fire-wielding knights and sky-bound castles, but no one truly believed — no one but Kael.

Kael was sixteen, with soot-stained hands from too many hours at the village forge and eyes that still looked to the stars as if they promised something more. He was the apprentice of Old Fenric, the blacksmith who spoke little and grumbled more. But Kael didn't mind. It gave him time to dream.

One late evening, as the forge's final embers flickered low, Kael noticed something strange beneath the anvil — a faint glow, like a dying coal that wouldn't fade. Curious, he pried up the loose stone tile it flickered from. Beneath it, buried in the earth, was a shard of crystal, warm to the touch and pulsing with a rhythm that felt… alive.

The moment Kael’s fingers closed around it, the world tilted.

Flames whooshed up from the forge — but they didn't burn. Instead, they danced, swirling around him like a living ribbon of fire. His skin tingled, and symbols he’d never seen before flared to life on the walls. Then a voice, ancient and slow, echoed in his mind:

“Emberlight awakens. The Warden returns.”

Kael staggered back, heart pounding. Warden? Emberlight? What did it mean?

Just then, the door creaked open. Fenric stood there, eyes wide — not with surprise, but fear. His gaze locked on the glowing shard in Kael’s hand.

“You shouldn’t have found that,” he whispered. “Not yet.”
