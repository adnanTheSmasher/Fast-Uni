Chapter 2: The Warden’s Legacy

Fenric slammed the forge door shut and bolted it. He lit a lantern with trembling hands, casting flickering shadows across the stone walls. Kael stood frozen, the crystal clutched tightly in his palm.

“What is this thing?” Kael finally asked. “Why does it feel like it’s… breathing?”

Fenric didn’t answer right away. He sat heavily on the workbench, as if the years he always carried finally caught up with him.

“I hoped it wouldn’t choose you,” he muttered. “Hoped it would stay buried.”

“Choose me?” Kael’s voice cracked. “What are you talking about?”

Fenric sighed. “You’re the last of the line. The Warden’s blood flows in you, Kael. That shard — it’s a piece of Emberlight, one of the primal fires forged by the ancient Wardens to hold back the Hollow.”

Kael blinked. “The Hollow? Like in the old stories?”

“They’re not stories,” Fenric snapped. “The Hollow is real. It sleeps beneath the mountains, feeding on silence, waiting for the fire to go out. That shard kept the flame alive, hidden from the world.”

Kael looked down at the crystal, its glow steady and strong.

“So what happens now?” he asked.

Fenric stood, retrieving a wrapped bundle from behind the forge. Inside was a map, a small dagger etched with runes, and a leather-bound journal bearing a crest Kael had only seen once — on the medallion his mother left him before she died.

“You go to Emberhold,” Fenric said. “To the ruins. To learn what it means to be a Warden. Because if you don’t... the Hollow will rise again. And this time, there may be no one left to stop it.”

Kael’s world, once small and simple, now stretched wide and dark before him. But somewhere inside, a flame had been lit.

And he would follow it — into the unknown.
